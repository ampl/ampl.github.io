# AMPL Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will introduce and explore the features and capabilities of AMPL, a powerful modeling language for optimization problems. 
By the end of this tutorial, you will have a strong foundation in using AMPL for optimization problem modeling and a better understanding of how to leverage AMPL's features to streamline your optimization workflow.
The tutorial is structured as follows:

* **Introduction**: We will provide an overview of AMPL, various ways of using it and the language itself, and its benefits for modeling optimization problems.

* **Our first model - the lemonade stand**: In this section, we will introduce a simple lemonade stand problem and guide you through the process of formulating the problem, creating AMPL model entities, expressing the problem using AMPL expressions, and finally solving the model. This example will serve as a gentle introduction to AMPL and its features.

* **Our second model - the mulled wine stand**: We present another example problem—a mulled wine stand—where we will reinforce the concepts introduced in the lemonade stand example. We will dive deeper into different ways of using AMPL and show additional useful language features. 

* **A general production model**: In this section, we will develop a more general production model that can be applied to multiple instances of a problem class. We will discuss the problem formulation, model development, and the process of solving different instances of the same model. This section will showcase the power and flexibility of AMPL, allowing you to create abstract models that can be effortlessly reused for various problem instances.
