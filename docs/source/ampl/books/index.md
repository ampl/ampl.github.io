## MO-Book: Hands-On Mathematical Optimization with AMPL in Python

The repository of notebooks [Hands-On Mathematical Optimization with AMPL in Python](https://ampl.com/mo-book/) introduce the concepts and tools of mathematical optimization with examples from a range of disciplines. The goals of these notebooks are to:

-   provide a foundation for hands-on learning of mathematical optimization,
-   demonstrate the tools and concepts of optimization with practical examples,
-   help readers to develop the practical skills needed to build models and solving problems using state-of-the-art modeling languages and solvers.
