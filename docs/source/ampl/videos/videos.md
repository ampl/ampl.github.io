## Adding Optimization to Your Applications

In this INFORMS webinar, learn the fundamentals of AMPL’s model-based approach to building optimization applications quickly and reliably:

-   Understand of the optimization modeling lifecycle and the components of the modern optimization toolchain.
-   Appreciate the benefits of model-based optimization for fast development and reliable deployment, including the advantages of modeling and modeling languages versus programming and programming languages for optimization.
-   See case studies of successful model-based optimization applications across a variety of business types.
