BARONMP Optimizer Options for AMPL
--------------------------------------------

To set these options, assign a string specifying their values to the AMPL
option "baronmp_options". For example:

   ampl: option baronmp_options 'mipgap=1e-6';

 Options:

      irrespective of solution quality. Default is 0, meaning that BARON will
      search for the best numsol feasible solutions.

alg:iisfind (iisfind, iis)
      Whether to find and export an IIS. Default = 0 (don't export).
