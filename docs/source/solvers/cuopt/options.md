CUOPTLP Optimizer Options for AMPL
--------------------------------------------

To set these options, assign a string specifying their values to the AMPL
option "cuoptmp_options". For example:

   ampl: option cuoptmp_options 'mipgap=1e-6';

'' Options:

acc:_all
      Solver acceptance level for all constraints and expressions. Value
      meaning: as described in the specific acc:... options.

      Can be useful to disable all reformulations (acc:_all=2), or force
      linearization (acc:_all=0.)

acc:lineq
      Solver acceptance level for 'LinConEQ' as flat constraint, default 2:

      0 - Not accepted natively, automatic redefinition will be attempted
      1 - Accepted but automatic redefinition will be used where possible
      2 - Accepted natively and preferred

acc:linge
      Solver acceptance level for 'LinConGE' as flat constraint, default 2:

      0 - Not accepted natively, automatic redefinition will be attempted
      1 - Accepted but automatic redefinition will be used where possible
      2 - Accepted natively and preferred

acc:linle
      Solver acceptance level for 'LinConLE' as flat constraint, default 2:

      0 - Not accepted natively, automatic redefinition will be attempted
      1 - Accepted but automatic redefinition will be used where possible
      2 - Accepted natively and preferred

alg:method (method)
      Designate the method to solve the LP problem:

      0 - Concurrent (default)
      1 - Pdlp
      2 - Dual simplex

alg:relax (relax)
      0*/1: Whether to relax integrality of variables.

alg:solver_mode (solver_mode)
      Designate the solver mode used by PDLP to solve the problem:

      0 - Stable1
      1 - Stable2 (default)
      2 - Methodical1
      3 - Fast1

cvt:bigM (cvt:bigm, cvt:mip:bigM, cvt:mip:bigm)
      Default value of big-M for linearization of logical constraints. Not
      used by default. Use with care (prefer tight bounds). Should be smaller
      than (1.0 / [integrality tolerance])

cvt:dvelim (dvelim)
      Eliminate AMPL defined variables by substitution into linear, quadratic,
      and polynomial expressions:

      0 - Do not eliminate, always instantiate the variables.
      1 - Eliminate only those used 1x. This can increase model density but
          greatly simplifies some models.
      2 - Always substitute where possible, even if the variable needs to be
          instantiated for use in other places. Can introduce redundancy, but
          seems best for some models (default.)

      See also AMPL options linelim and substout.

cvt:expcones (expcones)
      0*/1: Recognize exponential cones.

cvt:mip:eps (cvt:cmp:eps, cmp:eps)
      Tolerance for strict comparison of continuous variables for MIP. Applies
      to <, >, and != operators. Also applies to negation of conditional
      comparisons: b==1 <==> x<=5 means that with b==0, x>=5+eps. Default:
      1e-4.

cvt:multoutcard (multoutcard)
      Up to which (estimated) QP matrix cardinality should a product of 2
      linear expressions be multiplied out. Default 1e9.

      Can speed up model input, but prone to numerical issues.

cvt:names (names, modelnames)
      Whether to read or generate variable / constraint / objective names:

      0 - No names
      1 - (Default) Only provide names if at least one of .col / .row name
          files was written by AMPL (AMPL: `option [<solver>_]auxfiles rc;`) 
      2 - Read names from AMPL, but create generic names if not provided
      3 - Create generic names.

cvt:plapprox:domain (plapprox:domain, plapproxdomain)
      For piecewise-linear approximated functions, both arguments and result
      are bounded to +-[pladomain]. Default 1e6.

cvt:plapprox:reltol (plapprox:reltol, plapproxreltol)
      Relative tolerance for piecewise-linear approximation. Default 0.01.

cvt:pre:eqresult
      0/1*: Preprocess reified equality comparison's decidable cases.

cvt:pre:ineqresult
      0/1*: Preprocess reified inequality comparison's decidable cases.

cvt:pre:ineqrhs
      0/1*: Preprocess reified inequality comparison's right-hand sides.

cvt:pre:unnest
      0/1*: Inline nested expressions, currently Ands/Ors.

cvt:prod (cvt:pre:prod)
      Product preprocessing flags. Sum of a subset of the following bits:

      1 - Quadratize higher-order products in the following order: integer
      terms first, then real-valued ones; in each group, smaller-range terms
      first.
      2 - Logicalize products of 2 binary terms. Logicalizing means that the
      product is converted to a conjunction. If the solver does not support it
      natively (see acc:and), the conjunction is linearized.
      4 - Logicalize products of >=3 binary terms.

      Default: 7.

      Bits 2 or 4 imply bit 1.

cvt:qp2passes (cvt:qp2pass, qp2passes, qp2pass)
      Parse sums of QP expressions in 2 passes. Usually faster. Default 1.

cvt:quadcon (passquadcon)
      Convenience option. Set to 0 to disable quadratic constraints. Synonym
      for acc:quad..=0. Currently this disables out-multiplication of
      quadratic terms, then they are linearized.

cvt:quadobj (passquadobj)
      0*/1: Pass quadratic objective terms to the solver. When 0, if the
      solver accepts quadratic constraints, such a constraint will be created
      with those, otherwise linearly approximated.

cvt:socp (socpmode, socp)
      Second-Order Cone recognition mode:

      0 - Do not recognize SOCP forms
      1 - Recognize from non-quadratic expressions only (sqrt, abs)
      2 - Recognize from quadratic and non-quadratic SOCP forms. Helpful if
          the solver does not recognize non-standard forms

      Recognized SOCP forms can be further converted to (SOCP-standardized)
      quadratic constraints, see cvt:socp2qc. Default: 0.

cvt:socp2qc (socp2qcmode, socp2qc)
      Mode to convert recognized SOCP forms to SOCP-standardized quadratic
      constraints:

      0 - Do not convert
      1 - Convert if no other cone types found, and not all original
          quadratics could be recognized as SOC, in particular if the
          objective is quadratic
      2 - Always convert

      Such conversion can be necessary if the solver does not accept a mix of
      conic and quadratic constraints/objectives. Default: 2.

cvt:sos (sos)
      0/1*: Whether to honor declared suffixes .sosno and .ref describing SOS
      sets. Each distinct nonzero .sosno value designates an SOS set, of type
      1 for positive .sosno values and of type 2 for negative values. The .ref
      suffix contains corresponding reference values used to order the
      variables.

cvt:sos2 (sos2)
      0*/1: Whether to honor SOS2 constraints for nonconvex piecewise-linear
      terms, using suffixes .sos and .sosref provided by AMPL. Currently under
      rework.

      If cvt:uenc:ratio applies, max number of constants in comparisons
      x==const in negative context (equivalently, x!=const in positive
      context) to skip UEnc(x). Default 1.

cvt:uenc:ratio (uenc:ratio)
      Min ratio (ub-lb)/Nvalues to skip unary encoding for a variable x, where
      Nvalues is the number of constants used in conditional comparisons
      x==const. Instead, indicator constraints (or big-Ms) are used, if
      uenc:negctx also applies. Default 0.

lim:iterations (iterations)
      Iteration limit after which the solver will stop and return the current
      solution

lim:ncputhreads (ncputhreads)
      Number of CPU threads used in the LP and MIP solvers

mip:absgap (absgap)
      Absolute tolerance used to terminate the MIP solve

      Absolute tolerance used in mip

mip:bestbound (bestbound, return_bound)
      Whether to return suffix .bestbound for the best known MIP dual bound on
      the objective value:

      0 - No (default)
      1 - Yes.

      The suffix is on the objective and problem and is -Infinity for
      minimization problems and +Infinity for maximization problems if there
      are no integer variables or if a dual bound is not available.

mip:hueristicsonly (hueristicsonly)
      Run only the GPU heuristics

mip:inttol (inttol)
      Integrality tolerance used in mip

mip:reltol (reltol)
      Relative tolerance used in mip

      Whether to return mipgap suffixes or include mipgap values (|objectve -
      .bestbound|) in the solve_message: sum of

      1 - Return .relmipgap suffix (relative to |obj|)
      2 - Return .absmipgap suffix (absolute mipgap)
      4 - Suppress mipgap values in solve_message.

      Default = 0. The suffixes are on the objective and problem. Returned
      suffix values are +Infinity if no integer-feasible solution has been
      found, in which case no mipgap values are reported in the solve_message.

mip:round (round)
      Whether to round integer variables to integral values before returning
      the solution, and whether to report that the solver returned noninteger
      values for integer values: sum of

      1 ==> Round nonintegral integer variables
      2 ==> Modify solve_result
      4 ==> Modify solve_message

      Default = 0. Modifications that were or would be made are reported in
      solve_result and solve_message only if the maximum deviation from
      integrality exceeded mip:round_reptol.

mip:round_reptol (round_reptol)
      Tolerance for reporting rounding of integer variables to integer values;
      see "mip:round". Default = 1e-9.

mip:scale (scale)
      Apply Scaling to MIP problems

obj:multi (multiobj)
      Whether to use multi-objective optimization:

      0 - Single objective, see option obj:no (default)
      1 - Multi-objective, solver's native handling if available
      2 - Multi-objective, force emulation

      When obj:multi>0 and several objectives are present, suffixes
      .objpriority, .objweight, .objreltol, and .objabstol on the objectives
      are relevant. Objectives with greater .objpriority values (integer
      values) have higher priority. Objectives with the same .objpriority are
      weighted by .objweight, according to the option obj:multi:weight.

      Objectives with positive .objabstol or .objreltol are allowed to be
      degraded by lower priority objectives by amounts not exceeding the
      .objabstol (absolute) and .objreltol (relative) limits.

      Note that with solver's native handling (when obj:multi=1 and
      supported), some solvers might have special rules for the tolerances,
      especially for LP, and not allow quadratic objectives. See the solver
      documentation.

obj:multi:weight (multiobjweight, obj:multi:weights, multiobjweights)
      How to interpret each objective's weight sign:

      1 - relative to the sense of the 1st objective
      2 - relative to its own sense (default)

      With the 1st option (legacy behaviour), negative .objweight for
      objective i would make objective i's sense the opposite of the model's
      1st objective. Otherwise, it would make objective i's sense the opposite
      to its sense defined in the model.

obj:no (objno)
      Objective to optimize:

      0 - None
      1 - First (default, if available)
      2 - Second (if available), etc.

      Check even infeasible solution condidates, whenever solver reports them.

sol:chk:inttol (sol:chk:inteps, sol:inteps, chk:inttol)
      Solution checking tolerance for variables' integrality. Default 1e-5.

sol:chk:mode (solcheck, checkmode, chk:mode)
      Solution checking mode. Sum of a subset of the following bits:

      1 - Check variable bounds and integrality.
      2 - Check original model constraints, as well as any non-linear
      expression values reported by the solver.
      4 - Check intermediate auxiliary constraints (i.e., those which were
      reformulated further).
      8 - Check final auxiliary constraints sent to solver.
      16 - Check objective values.
      32, 64, 128, 256, 512 - similar, but non-linear expressions are
      recomputed (vs using their values reported by the solver.)
      *Experimental.* This is an idealistic check, because it does not
      consider possible tolerances applied by the solver when computing
      expression values.

      Default: 1+2+512.

sol:chk:prec (chk:prec, chk:precision)
      AMPL solution_precision option when checking: number of significant

      e.g., "lim:iter=500".

tech:outlev (outlev)
      Whether to log information to the console

tech:outlev_mp (outlev_mp)
      0*/1: whether to print MP model information.

      wall times. If set to 1, return the solution times in the problem
      suffixes 'time_solver', 'time_setup' and 'time', 'time'=
      time_solver+time_setup+time_output is a measure of the total time spent
      in the solver driver. If set to 2, return more granular times, including
      'time_read', 'time_conversion' and 'time_output'.
