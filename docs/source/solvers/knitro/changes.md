# KNITRO Changelog

## 20241220
- Updated to Knitro 14.2, changes include:
    - Significant performance improvements on nonconvex
      problems both in terms of efficiency and solution quality. 
    - Significant improvements in robustness and efficiency
      when solving models with conic constraints using the specialized
      conic algorithm (enabled via `bar_conic_enable=1`).
    - Improves the efficiency of the "ncvx_qcqp_init" user option,
      which can be used to improve the initial points when solving nonconvex
      QPs/QCQPs.
    - Ability to retrieve the best feasible iterate found during the 
      optimization by setting the new user option `soltype=1`.
    - New options for time limits:
      - `maxtime` - global time limit
      - `mip_sub_maxtime` - limit on MIP subproblems
      - `ma_sub_maxtime` - limit on multi-algorithm subproblems
      - `ms_sub_maxtime` - limit on multi-start subproblems

## 20160908
- Update to Knitro 10.1.2, which has some bug fixes.

## 20160831
- Relink to fix a bug in computing Hessians or Hessian-vector products when the same variable appears alone as the `then` or `else` part of two or more if-then-else expressions.

## 20160608

## 20151210
- Enable demo licenses.

## 20151208
- Linux library search rules adjusted for consistency with other solvers; this should be invisible to most users.

- Changed keyword: `lpsolver` --> `act_lpsolver`. New keywords: `act_qpalg`, `bar_watchdog`, `derivcheck_terminate`, `fstopval`, `ftol`, `ftol_iters`, `maxfevals`. See the `knitro -=` output for details.

## 20150814

## 20150424
- Fix a rarely seen licensing glitch.

## 20150226

## 20150203
- Fix a glitch with par_numthreads > 1 that caused some threads to see permuted Jacobian values and perform poorly.

## 20150126
- Relink Linux binaries to not require GLIBC 2.14.

## 20150122
- Relink to avoid trouble from miscomputed function values under unlikely conditions.

## 20150114
- Relink so `par_numthreads=n` with `n` > 1 works as intended. (Version 20150112 was an initial attempt at this that could fault.)

## 20141210
- Update to KNITRO 9.1, which has a new SQP algorithm and changes to some keywords; invoke `knitro -=` for a summary of the keywords.

## 20141124
- Relink for better handling of imported functions that report an inability compute derivatives.

## 20141102
- Relink to catch errors reported by imported functions.

## 20141013
- Relink macosx binary so licenses can consider both hostname and local hostname.

## 20141004
- Relink to fix a rarely seen bug in computing derivatives (incorrectly `fixed` in 20140929).

## 20140918
- Relink MacOSX binary so it will look in the directory containing the knitro binary (as well as in the standard places) for libiomp5.dylib. This library (libiomp5.dylib, a support library for OpenMP) could well be used by other programs (if installed on the current system), in which case the best place for it is probably /usr/local/lib. The updated knitro binary, like the previous one, will also look in /usr/local/lib for libiomp5.dylib.

## 20140409
- Relink 64-bit Linux binary to remove a dependency on GLIBC_2.14. `knitro -v` shows `driver(20140407), ASL(20140313)`.

## 20140306
- Update to KNITRO 9.0.1, which has some bug fixes.

## 20140305
- Relink to fix a possible fault on problems where `objrep` matters. The 32-bit Linux and Solaris-Intel binaries remain at KNITRO 8.1.1.

## 20131219
- Update to KNITRO 9.0.0. New keywords `bar_relaxcons`, `linsolver_ooc`, `lsnumthreads` (synonym `par_lsnumthreads`), `optionsfile`, `tuner`, `tuner_maxtime_cpu`, `tuner_maxtime_real`, `tuner_optionsfile`, `tuner_outsub`, `tuner_terminate`. More values (2 and 3, rather than just 0 and 1) for `feasible`. New suffixes `cfeastol`, `relaxbnd`, `xfeastol`. See the updated documentation.

## 20131023
- Ignore case in MAC addresses during license checks (an issue rarely seen). When ending execution under a floating license, try to read a reply from the license manager to circumvent bug sometimes seen in MS Windows.

## 20131018
- Relink to extend library renaming: if an imported-function library name has `_32` or `_64` before the final `.` and fails to load (perhaps after changing `32` to `64` or vice versa, as appropriate), try omitting the `_32` or `_64`.

## 20131011
- When more than one objective is present, if objno is not specified in $knitro_options, behave like other solvers by assuming objno=1, rather than giving exit code 1.

## 20130823
- Fix possible litch (error message `bad e->a = ...`) with Hessian computations when if-then-else, min(...), and max(...) are involved. Fix bug with `objno=...` when there are multiple objectives (possible wrong weight in Lagrangian Hessian).

## 20130606
- Relink to fix a fault that was sometimes possible with `objrep`=2 or `objrep`=3.

## 20130525
- Adjust driver to accept problems with nodes and arcs.

## 20130419
- Fix a rarely seen bug (possible fault) with defined variables.

## 20130320
- Relink MS Windows versions to make automatic starting of ampl_lic work better on some versions of MS Windows (not XP). It is still recommended not to rely on automatically starting ampl_lic.

## 20130308
- Relink MacOSX version to remove dependency on /usr/local/lib/libgomp1.dylib .

## 20130130
- Relink 64-bit Linux version to avoid the need for GLIBC_2.14.

## 20121220
- Update to KNITRO 8.1 (currently 8.1.1).

## 20120813
- Relink 64-bit Linux version to avoid the need for GLIBC_2.14.

## 20120624
- Relink to fix a bug with complementarity problems having integer variables. (KNITRO still does not handle such problems well.) Again add vcomp100.dll to the mswin64 bundle; it was mistakenly left out of recent versions of this bundle.

## 20120620
- Relink to give a sparser Hessian in some cases of division by a constant.

## 20120608
- Fix a glitch that prevented a .sol file from being written when hessopt=n appears in $knitro_options with n = 2, 3, 4, or 6. (These settings are probably seldom if ever desirable.)

## 20120320
- Adjust license-check in Linux versions for use with FreeBSD.

## 20120120
- Relink to handle library names with '.' in a directory name but not in the basename (i.e., the name of the imported-function library).

## 20120117
- Relink to simplify using a 64-bit knitro with a 32-bit AMPL or vice versa when imported functions are involved (loaded from a *.dll file). For a 64-bit knitro, if the library name involves '.' and the final '.' is preceded by `_32`, change the `32` to `64`. Otherwise, if the library fails to load and there is a '.' in the name, insert `_64` before the final '.'. (For 32-bit solvers, the rules are similar, with the roles of `32` and `64` reversed.)

## 20120115
- Adding Microsoft's `redistributable` vcomp100.dll to the mswin64 bundle for KNITRO. It (vcomp100.dll) is only licensed for use with knitro.exe and other programs compiled by Microsoft's Visual Studio 10. If knitro.exe runs on your system without adding vcomp100.dll from the knitro.mswin64.*.zip bundle, then your system must already have a copy of vcomp100.dll in $Path, in which case you do not need a second copy.

## 20111229
- Relink for use with single-user licenses.

## 20111206
- Update to KNITRO 8.0. There is no 32-bit MacOSX version; use the 64-bit version instead. (You can use a 32-bit AMPL with a 64-bit solver, and vice versa.) The MKL blas are now built into the knitro binaries.

## 20111107
- Permit use of single-user licenses.

## 20111018
- Relink to fix possible trouble with some complementarity problems.

## 20111005
- Fix a possible fault in some cases when `objrep` > 0.

## 20111003
- When processing ampl.lic, ignore new keywords for ampl.netlic.

## 20110915
- Adding MKL blas libraries to mswin32 and mswin64 bundles.

## 20110822
- New keyword available in $knitro_options: `objrep` controls whether a linear objective involving a single variable that appears linearly in exactly one constraint is replaced by the body of the constraint. Invoke `knitro -=` for details.
- Complementarity problems are now handled in full generality.
- A rarely-seen fault (a bug in the solver-interface library) is now fixed.

## 20110527
- Relink to permit a quoted `hostname` for MGR_IP in the ampl.lic file for a floating license.

## 20110426
- Tweak license checker to correct a rare problem on MS Windows systems.

## 20110117
- Mention `knitro` in the `No license for this machine` message.

## 20101013
- Update to KNITRO 7.0.
