      terms first, then real-valued ones; in each group, smaller-range terms
      first.
      2 - Logicalize products of 2 binary terms. Logicalizing means that the
      product is converted to a conjunction. If the solver does not support it
      natively (see acc:and), the conjunction is linearized.
      4 - Logicalize products of >=3 binary terms.

      Default: 7.

      Bits 2 or 4 imply bit 1.

      quadratic terms, then they are linearized.

cvt:quadobj (passquadobj)

      Such conversion can be necessary if the solver does not accept a mix of
      conic and quadratic constraints/objectives. Default: 2.

cvt:sos (sos)

      sets. Each distinct nonzero .sosno value designates an SOS set, of type
      1 for positive .sosno values and of type 2 for negative values. The .ref
      suffix contains corresponding reference values used to order the
      variables.

      2 - Return .absmipgap suffix (absolute mipgap)
      4 - Suppress mipgap values in solve_message.

      Default = 0. The suffixes are on the objective and problem. Returned

      found, in which case no mipgap values are reported in the solve_message.

mip:round (round)

      the solution, and whether to report that the solver returned noninteger
      values for integer values: sum of

      When obj:multi>0 and several objectives are present, suffixes
      .objpriority, .objweight, .objreltol, and .objabstol on the objectives
      are relevant. Objectives with greater .objpriority values (integer
      values) have higher priority. Objectives with the same .objpriority are
      weighted by .objweight, according to the option obj:multi:weight.

      Objectives with positive .objabstol or .objreltol are allowed to be
      degraded by lower priority objectives by amounts not exceeding the
      .objabstol (absolute) and .objreltol (relative) limits.

      Note that with solver's native handling (when obj:multi=1 and
      supported), some solvers might have special rules for the tolerances,
      especially for LP, and not allow quadratic objectives. See the solver
      documentation.

obj:multi:weight (multiobjweight, obj:multi:weights, multiobjweights)

      1 - relative to the sense of the 1st objective
      2 - relative to its own sense (default)

      With the 1st option (legacy behaviour), negative .objweight for
      objective i would make objective i's sense the opposite of the model's
      1st objective. Otherwise, it would make objective i's sense the opposite
      to its sense defined in the model.

obj:no (objno)
      Objective to optimize:

      0 - None

      4 - Check intermediate auxiliary constraints (i.e., those which were
      reformulated further).
      8 - Check final auxiliary constraints sent to solver.

      *Experimental.* This is an idealistic check, because it does not
      consider possible tolerances applied by the solver when computing
      expression values.

tech:miploglev (miploglev, mip_report_level)
      0/1*/2: MIP solver report level

tech:optionfile (optionfile, option:file)
      Name of an AMPL solver option file to read (surrounded by 'single' or
      "double" quotes if the name contains blanks). Lines that start with #
      are ignored. Otherwise, each nonempty line should contain "name=value",
      e.g., "lim:iter=500".

tech:outlev (outlev)
      0*/1: Whether to write HighS log lines (chatter) to stdout and to file.

tech:outlev_mp (outlev_mp)
      0*/1: whether to print MP model information.

tech:seed (seed, random_seed)
      Random number seed (default 0), affecting perturbations that may
      influence the solution path.

tech:threads (threads)
      How many threads to use when using the barrier algorithm or solving MIP
      problems; default 0 ==> automatic choice.

tech:timing (timing, tech:report_times, report_times)
      0*/1/2: Whether to print and return timings for the run, all times are
      wall times. If set to 1, return the solution times in the problem
      suffixes 'time_solver', 'time_setup' and 'time', 'time'=
      time_solver+time_setup+time_output is a measure of the total time spent
      in the solver driver. If set to 2, return more granular times, including
      'time_read', 'time_conversion' and 'time_output'.

tech:version (version)
      Single-word phrase: report version details before solving the problem.

tech:wantsol (wantsol)
      In a stand-alone invocation (no "-AMPL" on the command line), what
      solution information to write. Sum of

      1 - Write ".sol" file
      2 - Primal variables to stdout
      4 - Dual variables to stdout
      8 - Suppress solution message.

tech:writegraph (cvt:writegraph, writegraph, exportgraph)
      File to export conversion graph. Format: JSON Lines.

tech:writemodel (tech:writeprob, writeprob, writemodel, tech:exportfile)
      Specifies files where to export the model before solving (repeat the
      option for several files.) File name extensions can be ".lp[.7z]",
      ".mps", etc.
      To write a model during iterative solve (e.g., with obj:multi=2), use
      tech:writemodel:index.

tech:writemodel:index (tech:writeprob:index, writeprobindex, writemodelindex)
      During iterative solve (e.g., with obj:multi=2), the iteration before
      which to write solver model. 0 means before iteration is initialized;
      positive value - before solving that iteration. Default 0.

tech:writemodelonly (justwriteprob, justwritemodel)
      Specifies files where to export the model, no solving (option can be
      repeated.) File extensions can be ".dlp", ".mps", etc.

tech:writesolution (writesol, writesolution)
      Specifies the names of files where to export the solution and/or other
      result files in solver's native formats. Option can be repeated. File
      name extensions can be ".sol[.tar.gz]", ".json", ".bas", ".ilp", etc.
