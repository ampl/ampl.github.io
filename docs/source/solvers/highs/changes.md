# HiGHS Changelog

## 20251121
- New option *obj:multi:options* to control
  whether multi-objective option suffixes
  are used.


## 20251015
- Changes in MP


## 20250814
- Changes in MP
  - Improved preprocessing of logical
    and combinatorial expressions
    (options cvt:pre:unnest, cvt:pre:sort).
  - Option cvt:pre:boundlogarg (default 0) to bound
    arguments of logarithm nonnegative. Previously
    always done, sometimes deteriorating performance
    of nonlinear solvers.


## 20250801
- Changes in MP
  - Tolerances set by options pre:feastol,
    pre:feastolrel both need to be violated
    to produce a warning on contradicting
    variable/constraint bounds. Previously
    the preprocessor failed on any violation,
    without letting the solver try.
  - Options cvt:compl, cvt:compl:eps control
    complementarity reformulations.


## 20250617
- Updated to HiGHS 1.11
- Renamed *pdlp_d_gap_tol* to *pdlpopttol* for consistency
  with IPM
- Changes in MP
  - Multi-objective emulator: added support for
    objective-specific options via objective suffixes
    beginning with *option_*
  - Option *cvt:unnest*: bits 2 and 4 switch on
    inlining of linear and quadratic subexpressions
    produced during reformulations (by default on).
  - Options *cvt:pre:ctx2ineq*, *cvt:pre:ctx2count*
    to control context propagation into conditional
    comparisons #267.


## 20250429
- Fix a bug in parsing of quadratic expressions,
  which could wrongly parse products of unequal
  linear expressions, such as (x-3)*(x-z-5).


## 20250424
- Changes in MP
  - Option cvt:qp2pass (default even faster parsing
    of quadratics)


## 20250329
- Changes in MP:
  - Option cvt:multoutcard to limit the size of
    out-multiplied QP expressions. Can improve speed
    on large models.
  - Improved parsing of quadratic expressions.


## 20250320
- Updated to HiGHS 1.10, which include GPU support for cuPDLP-C, 
  lifting for probing (see `mip:lifting`), and bug fixes
- Added support for PDLP on NVIDIA GPU, accessible with `alg:method=pdlp-gpu`.
  It requires Linux/Windows and NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.
- Added options `tech:seed`, `alg:pdlperestartmethod`, `alg:dualrestol`
- Disabled native multiobjective suppport, as it exhibited
  a behaviour not consistent with the MO emulator. 
  Multi objective problems can still be solved specifying option
  *multiobj=1*, that will use MP's MO emulator.


## 20250308
- Updated to HiGHS 1.9.0.
- Added native multiobjective suppport.


## 20241119
- Updated to HiGHS 1.8.1.
- Options mip:gap (renamed from relgaptol), mip:gapabs
  aligned to other MP solvers.


## 20240724
- Option *acc:_all*
	- Useful to disable all reformulations (acc:_all=2),
		or force linearization (acc:_all=0).
- Option *cvt:prod*     
  - Controls reformulation of binary products into logical 
    constraints.
- Faster input of quadratic expressions.


## 20240627
- Updated to HiGHS 1.7.1
- Added calculation of primal and dual rays.
	See keyword `alg:rays`.


## 20240617
- *Multi-objective emulator*
	- obj:multi=2 forces emulation, even if MO natively supported.
	- Fixed a bug in the objective degradation suffixes
		.objasbtol, .objreltol.


## 20240604
- Presolve division by constant, resulting in fewer constraints
- Fix no-solution case in multi-objective emulator


## 20240529
- *Multi-objective emulator*
	- All flat MP solvers support multi-objective mode (obj:multi=1),
		either natively, or via emulation.
	- Suffixes .objpriority, .objweight, .objabstol, .objreltol.
	- [BREAKING] Default intuitive handling of .objweight,
		see option obj:multi:weight, even when natively supported.


## 20240429
- [BREAKING] Merged `report_times` and `timing`; they 
  are now aliases, set the value to 1 to have basic info,
  to 2 to have more detailed info.


## 20240320
- *SOS constraints*.
  - Fixed handling of SOS2 constraints created by AMPL
    as reformulations of PL expressions (`option
    pl_linearize 1`, default; set to 0 to use 
    MP linearization.)
  - Disallow repeated weights for SOS constraints
    (suffixes `.sosno`/`.ref`.)
- *Option `report_times`* 
- *Unused `acc:` options*.
  - The constraint acceptance options `acc:...`
    for non-handled constraints are ignored
    (previously triggered error.)


## 20240307
- *Updated* to HiGHS 1.7.0
- Added solver pdlp (use option `alg:method` to specify it and
  `alg:pdlpdgaptol`, `lim:pdlpnativetermination`, `pre:pdlpscaling` 
  and `lim:pdlpiterationlimit`).
- Added optional pre centring steps (see options `pre:centring`,
  `pre:maxcentringsteps` and `pre:centringratiotolerance`).
- Added options `pre:userboundscale`, `pre:usercostscale`, 
  `lim:objectivebound` and `lim:objectivetarget`.


## 20240115
- *Solve result codes*
  - List codes by running (solver) -!
  - [BREAKING] Standardized codes. Major changes:
    - 100-199 (solved?) means solution candidate
      provided, but can be suboptimal/infeasible
    - 300-349 means unbounded problem but
      feasible solution returned
    - 400-449 means limit/interrupt but feasible
  - [BREAKING] sol:chk:fail returns code 150 (solved?)
- Compact solution check warnings
- Fixed presolve of the power function #226.
