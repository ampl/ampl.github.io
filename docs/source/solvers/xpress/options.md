      The default number of threads used during optimization.;default - 1 ==>
      automatic choice.

tech:timing (timing, tech:report_times, report_times)
      0*/1/2: Whether to print and return timings for the run, all times are
      wall times. If set to 1, return the solution times in the problem
      suffixes 'time_solver', 'time_setup' and 'time', 'time'=
      time_solver+time_setup+time_output is a measure of the total time spent
      in the solver driver. If set to 2, return more granular times, including
      'time_read', 'time_conversion' and 'time_output'.

tech:tunebase (tunerdir, tunebase)
      Base name for results of running XPRESS's search for best parameter
      settings. The search is run only when tunebase is specified. This
      control only defines the root path for the tuner output. For each
      problem, the tuner result will be output to a subfolder underneath this
      path. For example, by default, the tuner result for a problem called
      prob will be located at tuneroutput/prob/

tech:tunename (tunesessionname)
      Set problem name within the tuner "tunebase" is specified.

tech:tuneoutput (tuneroutput, tuneoutput)
      Output tuner results and logs to the file system when "tunebase" is
      specified:

      0 - No
      1 - Yes (default)

tech:tunerhistory (tunerhistory)
      Reuse and append to previous tuner results of the same problem:

      tuner:

      - 1 - automatic choice(default)
      0   - solution time, then integrality gap
      1   - solution time, then best bound
      2   - solution time, then best integer solution
      3   - the "primal dual integral", whatever that is
      4   - just solution time (default for LPs)
      5   - just objective value

      Single-word phrase: report version details before solving the problem.

tech:wantsol (wantsol)
      In a stand-alone invocation (no "-AMPL" on the command line), what
      solution information to write. Sum of

      1 - Write ".sol" file
      2 - Primal variables to stdout
      4 - Dual variables to stdout
      8 - Suppress solution message.

tech:writemodel (writeprob, writemodel, tech:exportfile)
      Specifies files where to export the model before solving (repeat the
      option for several files.) File name extensions can be ".lp[.7z]",
      ".mps", etc.

tech:writemodelonly (justwriteprob, justwritemodel)
      Specifies files where to export the model, no solving (option can be
