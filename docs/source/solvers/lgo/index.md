# LGO

LGO is capable of determining high-quality solutions to global optimization problems with continuous variables that have (possibly many) locally optimal solutions. Because LGO makes only limited assumptions as to problem structure and differentiability, it can be applied in a broad range of design and operational applications.

## How to use it

```{eval-rst}

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: AMPL

        .. code-block:: ampl

            ampl: option solver lgo; # change the solver
            ampl: option lgo_options 'option1=value1 option2=value2'; # specify options
            ampl: solve; # solve the problem

        How to install using `amplpy <https://amplpy.ampl.com>`_:

        .. code-block:: bash

            # Install Python API for AMPL:
            $ python -m pip install amplpy --upgrade

            # Install AMPL & solver modules:
            $ python -m amplpy.modules install lgo # install LGO

            # Activate your license (e.g., free ampl.com/ce or ampl.com/courses licenses):
            $ python -m amplpy.modules activate <your-license-uuid>

        How to use:

        .. code-block:: python

            from amplpy import AMPL
            ampl = AMPL()
            ...
            ampl.solve(solver="lgo", lgo_options="option1=value1 option2=value2")
