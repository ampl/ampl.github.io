cvt:mip:eps (cvt:cmp:eps, cmp:eps)
      Tolerance for strict comparison of continuous variables for MIP. Applies

      1e-4.

cvt:names (names, modelnames)
      Whether to read or generate variable / constraint / objective names:

      0 - No names

cvt:quadcon (passquadcon)
      Convenience option. Set to 0 to disable quadratic constraints. Synonym
      for acc:quad..=0. Currently this disables out-multiplication of
      quadratic terms, then they are linearized.

cvt:quadobj (passquadobj)
      0/1*: Multiply out and pass quadratic objective terms to the solver, vs.
      linear approximation.

cvt:socp (socpmode, socp)

      0 - Do not recognize SOCP forms
      1 - Recognize from non-quadratic expressions only (sqrt, abs)
      2 - Recognize from quadratic and non-quadratic SOCP forms. Helpful if
          the solver does not recognize non-standard forms

      Recognized SOCP forms can be further converted to (SOCP-standardized)
      quadratic constraints, see cvt:socp2qc. Default: 2.

      conic and quadratic constraints/objectives. Default: 1.

cvt:sos (sos)

      sets. Each distinct nonzero .sosno value designates an SOS set, of type

      suffix contains corresponding reference values used to order the
      variables.

      terms, using suffixes .sos and .sosref provided by AMPL.

      1 - Yes.

      The suffix is on the objective and problem and is -Infinity for
      minimization problems and +Infinity for maximization problems if there
      are no integer variables or if a dual bound is not available.

mip:constructsol (mipconstructsol)
      Sets MSK_IPAR_MIO_CONSTRUCT_SOL. If set to MSK_ON and all integer
      variables have been given a value for which a feasible mixed integer
      solution exists, then MOSEK generates an initial solution to the mixed
      integer problem by fixing all integer values and solving the remaining
      problem.Default = OFF

      .bestbound|) in the solve_message: sum of

      1 - Return .relmipgap suffix (relative to |obj|)
      2 - Return .absmipgap suffix (absolute mipgap)
      4 - Suppress mipgap values in solve_message.

      Default = 0. The suffixes are on the objective and problem. Returned
      suffix values are +Infinity if no integer-feasible solution has been
      found, in which case no mipgap values are reported in the solve_message.

mip:round (round)
      Whether to round integer variables to integral values before returning
      the solution, and whether to report that the solver returned noninteger
      values for integer values: sum of

      1 ==> Round nonintegral integer variables
      2 ==> Modify solve_result
      4 ==> Modify solve_message

      Default = 0. Modifications that were or would be made are reported in
      solve_result and solve_message only if the maximum deviation from
      integrality exceeded mip:round_reptol.

mip:round_reptol (round_reptol)

sol:chk:mode (solcheck, checkmode, chk:mode)
      Solution checking mode. Sum of a subset of the following bits:

      expression values reported by the solver.
      4 - Check intermediate auxiliary constraints (i.e., those which were
      reformulated further).
      8 - Check final auxiliary constraints sent to solver.
      16 - Check objective values.
      32, 64, 128, 256, 512 - similar, but non-linear expressions are
      recomputed (vs using their values reported by the solver.)
      *Experimental.* This is an idealistic check, because it does not
      consider possible tolerances applied by the solver when computing
      expression values.
