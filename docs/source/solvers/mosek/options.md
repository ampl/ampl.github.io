      0/1*: Recognize exponential cones.

cvt:mip:eps (cvt:cmp:eps, cmp:eps)

      1e-4.

cvt:multoutcard (multoutcard)
      Up to which (estimated) QP matrix cardinality should a product of 2
      linear expressions be multiplied out. Default 1e9.

      0 - No names
      1 - (Default) Only provide names if at least one of .col / .row name
          files was written by AMPL (AMPL: `option [<solver>_]auxfiles rc;`) 
      2 - Read names from AMPL, but create generic names if not provided
      3 - Create generic names.

cvt:plapprox:domain (plapprox:domain, plapproxdomain)
      For piecewise-linear approximated functions, both arguments and result
      are bounded to +-[pladomain]. Default 1e6.

cvt:plapprox:reltol (plapprox:reltol, plapproxreltol)
      Relative tolerance for piecewise-linear approximation. Default 0.01.

cvt:pre:ctx2count (ctx2count)
      Propagate exact context into atleast/atmost/exactly, count and numberof
      expressions, vs mixed. Bitwise OR of the following values:

      terms first, then real-valued ones; in each group, smaller-range terms
      first.
      2 - Logicalize products of 2 binary terms. Logicalizing means that the
      product is converted to a conjunction. If the solver does not support it
      natively (see acc:and), the conjunction is linearized.
      4 - Logicalize products of >=3 binary terms.

      Default: 7.

      Bits 2 or 4 imply bit 1.

cvt:qp2passes (cvt:qp2pass, qp2passes, qp2pass)

cvt:quadcon (passquadcon)
      Convenience option. Set to 0 to disable quadratic constraints. Synonym
      for acc:quad..=0. Currently this disables out-multiplication of
      quadratic terms, then they are linearized.

cvt:quadobj (passquadobj)
      0/1*: Pass quadratic objective terms to the solver. When 0, if the
      solver accepts quadratic constraints, such a constraint will be created
      with those, otherwise linearly approximated.

      0 - Do not recognize SOCP forms
      1 - Recognize from non-quadratic expressions only (sqrt, abs)
      2 - Recognize from quadratic and non-quadratic SOCP forms. Helpful if
          the solver does not recognize non-standard forms

      Recognized SOCP forms can be further converted to (SOCP-standardized)
      quadratic constraints, see cvt:socp2qc. Default: 2.

cvt:socp2qc (socp2qcmode, socp2qc)
      Mode to convert recognized SOCP forms to SOCP-standardized quadratic
      constraints:

      0 - Do not convert
      1 - Convert if no other cone types found, and not all original
          quadratics could be recognized as SOC, in particular if the
          objective is quadratic
      2 - Always convert

      Such conversion can be necessary if the solver does not accept a mix of
      conic and quadratic constraints/objectives. Default: 1.

cvt:sos (sos)
      0/1*: Whether to honor declared suffixes .sosno and .ref describing SOS
      sets. Each distinct nonzero .sosno value designates an SOS set, of type
      1 for positive .sosno values and of type 2 for negative values. The .ref
      suffix contains corresponding reference values used to order the
      variables.

cvt:sos2 (sos2)
      0*/1: Whether to honor SOS2 constraints for nonconvex piecewise-linear
      terms, using suffixes .sos and .sosref provided by AMPL. Currently under

      context) to skip UEnc(x). Default 1.

cvt:uenc:ratio (uenc:ratio)
      Min ratio (ub-lb)/Nvalues to skip unary encoding for a variable x, where
      Nvalues is the number of constants used in conditional comparisons
      x==const. Instead, indicator constraints (or big-Ms) are used, if
      uenc:negctx also applies. Default 0.

lim:sol (sollimit, solutionlimit)
      Limit the number of feasible MIP solutions found, causing early
      termination if exceeded; default -1 (no limit).

lim:time (timelim, timelimit)
      Limit on solve time (in seconds; default: no limit).

mip:bestbound (bestbound, return_bound)
      Whether to return suffix .bestbound for the best known MIP dual bound on
      the objective value:

      0 - No (default)
      1 - Yes.

      The suffix is on the objective and problem and is -Infinity for
      minimization problems and +Infinity for maximization problems if there
      are no integer variables or if a dual bound is not available.

mip:conic:outapprox (conicoutapprox)
      0*/1: If this option is turned on outer approximation is used when
      solving relaxations of conic problems; otherwise interior point is used.

mip:constructsol (mipconstructsol)
      Sets MSK_IPAR_MIO_CONSTRUCT_SOL. If set to MSK_ON and all integer
      variables have been given a value for which a feasible mixed integer

           quality
      2  - The Feasibility Pump is enabled with an effort to reach
           feasibility early

      MIP feasibility tolerance.

mip:gap (mipgap)
      Max. relative MIP optimality gap (default 1e-4).

mip:gapabs (mipgapabs)
      Max. absolute MIP optimality gap (default 0.0).

mip:heurlevel (heurlevel)
      MIP heuristic level to find an initial good feasible solution.

      -1: automatic (default);
      0: not used;
      positive, larger - more effort (3-5 recommended).

mip:inttol (inttol)
      MIP integrality tolerance.

mip:relgapconst (miorelgapconst)
      This value is used to compute the relative gap for the solution to an
      integer optimization problem.Default = 1.0e-10

      .bestbound|) in the solve_message: sum of

      1 - Return .relmipgap suffix (relative to |obj|)
      2 - Return .absmipgap suffix (absolute mipgap)
      4 - Suppress mipgap values in solve_message.

      Default = 0. The suffixes are on the objective and problem. Returned
      suffix values are +Infinity if no integer-feasible solution has been
      found, in which case no mipgap values are reported in the solve_message.

mip:round (round)
      Whether to round integer variables to integral values before returning
      the solution, and whether to report that the solver returned noninteger
      values for integer values: sum of

      1 ==> Round nonintegral integer variables
      2 ==> Modify solve_result
      4 ==> Modify solve_message

      Default = 0. Modifications that were or would be made are reported in
      solve_result and solve_message only if the maximum deviation from
      integrality exceeded mip:round_reptol.

mip:round_reptol (round_reptol)
      Tolerance for reporting rounding of integer variables to integer values;
      see "mip:round". Default = 1e-9.

mip:varselection (varselection)
      Controls the variable selection strategy employed by the mixed-integer
      optimizer:

      0 - Automatic (default)
      1 - Pseudocost variable selection
      2 - Strong branching selection

obj:multi (multiobj)
      Whether to use multi-objective optimization:

      0 - Single objective, see option obj:no (default)
      1 - Multi-objective, solver's native handling if available
      2 - Multi-objective, force emulation

      When obj:multi>0 and several objectives are present, suffixes
      .objpriority, .objweight, .objreltol, and .objabstol on the objectives
      are relevant. Objectives with greater .objpriority values (integer
      values) have higher priority. Objectives with the same .objpriority are
      weighted by .objweight, according to the option obj:multi:weight.

      Objectives with positive .objabstol or .objreltol are allowed to be
      degraded by lower priority objectives by amounts not exceeding the
      .objabstol (absolute) and .objreltol (relative) limits.

      Note that with solver's native handling (when obj:multi=1 and
      supported), some solvers might have special rules for the tolerances,
      especially for LP, and not allow quadratic objectives. See the solver
      documentation.

obj:multi:weight (multiobjweight, obj:multi:weights, multiobjweights)
      How to interpret each objective's weight sign:

      1 - relative to the sense of the 1st objective
      2 - relative to its own sense (default)

      With the 1st option (legacy behaviour), negative .objweight for
      objective i would make objective i's sense the opposite of the model's
      1st objective. Otherwise, it would make objective i's sense the opposite
      to its sense defined in the model.

obj:no (objno)
      Objective to optimize:

      0 - None
      1 - First (default, if available)

      1  - Low amount of analyis
      2  - Higher amount of analysis

pre:folding (folding, foldinguse)
      Whether to use folding in presolve (for MIP problems use
      pre:mipfolding):

      0 - Disabled
      1 - The solver decides on the usage and amount of folding
      2 - If only the interior-point solution is requested then the solver
          decides; if the basic solution is requested then folding is disabled
          (default)
      3 - Full folding is always performed regardless of workload

pre:mipfolding (mipfolding, miosimmetrylevel)
      Controls the amount of symmetry detection by the mixed-integer optimizer
      in presolve:

      -1 - Automatic
      0  - Disabled
      1  - Low amount
      2  - Medium amount
      3  - High amount
      4  - Extremely high amount

pre:passes (prepasses)
      Limit on the number of presolve passes; a negative value implies MOSEK
      decides:

      -1 - Automatic choice (default)
      n>=0 - At most n passes.

pre:scale (scale)
      Whether to use scaling in presolve. Applies to both simplex and interior
      point method:

      4 - Check intermediate auxiliary constraints (i.e., those which were
      reformulated further).
      8 - Check final auxiliary constraints sent to solver.
      16 - Check objective values.

      recomputed (vs using their values reported by the solver.)
      *Experimental.* This is an idealistic check, because it does not
      consider possible tolerances applied by the solver when computing
      expression values.

      parameters; value should be a quoted string (delimited by ' or ")
      containing a parameter name, a space, and the value to be assigned to
      the parameter. Can appear more than once. Cannot be used to query
      current parameter values.

tech:optionnativeread (optionnativeread, tech:param:read, param:read)
      Name of Mosek parameter file (surrounded by 'single' or "double" quotes
      if the name contains blanks) to be read. File format:

      BEGIN MOSEK
      MSK_DPAR_MIO_MAX_TIME 3
      END MOSEK

      Parameter descriptions:
      docs.mosek.com/latest/cmdtools/param-groups.html.

tech:optionnativewrite (optionnativewrite, tech:param:write, param:write)
      Name of Mosek parameter file (surrounded by 'single' or "double" quotes
      if the name contains blanks) to be written.

tech:outlev (outlev)
      0*/1: Whether to write mosek log lines to stdout and to the logfile.

tech:outlev_mp (outlev_mp)
      0*/1: whether to print MP model information.

tech:seed (seed)
      Random number seed (default 42), used for randomization in the
      mixed-integer optimizer, may influence the solution path.

tech:threads (threads)
      Controls the number of threads employed by the optimizer. Default 0 ==>
      number of threads used will be equal to the number of cores detected on
      the machine.

tech:timing (timing, tech:report_times, report_times)
      0*/1/2: Whether to print and return timings for the run, all times are
      wall times. If set to 1, return the solution times in the problem
      suffixes 'time_solver', 'time_setup' and 'time', 'time'=
      time_solver+time_setup+time_output is a measure of the total time spent
      in the solver driver. If set to 2, return more granular times, including
      'time_read', 'time_conversion' and 'time_output'.

tech:version (version)
      Single-word phrase: report version details before solving the problem.

tech:wantsol (wantsol)
      In a stand-alone invocation (no "-AMPL" on the command line), what
      solution information to write. Sum of

      1 - Write ".sol" file
      2 - Primal variables to stdout
      4 - Dual variables to stdout
      8 - Suppress solution message.

tech:writegraph (cvt:writegraph, writegraph, exportgraph)
      File to export conversion graph. Format: JSON Lines.

tech:writemodel (tech:writeprob, writeprob, writemodel, tech:exportfile)
      Specifies files where to export the model before solving (repeat the
      option for several files.) File name extensions can be ".lp[.7z]",
      ".mps", etc.
      To write a model during iterative solve (e.g., with obj:multi=2), use
      tech:writemodel:index.

tech:writemodel:index (tech:writeprob:index, writeprobindex, writemodelindex)
      During iterative solve (e.g., with obj:multi=2), the iteration before
      which to write solver model. 0 means before iteration is initialized;
      positive value - before solving that iteration. Default 0.

tech:writemodelonly (justwriteprob, justwritemodel)
      Specifies files where to export the model, no solving (option can be
      repeated.) File extensions can be ".dlp", ".mps", etc.
