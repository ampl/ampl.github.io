cvt:quadcon (passquadcon)
      Convenience option. Set to 0 to disable quadratic constraints. Synonym
      for acc:quad..=0. Currently this disables out-multiplication of
      quadratic terms, then they are linearized.

cvt:quadobj (passquadobj)
      0/1*: Pass quadratic objective terms to the solver. When 0, if the
      solver accepts quadratic constraints, such a constraint will be created
      with those, otherwise linearly approximated.

cvt:socp (socpmode, socp)
      Second-Order Cone recognition mode:

      0 - Do not recognize SOCP forms
      1 - Recognize from non-quadratic expressions only (sqrt, abs)
      2 - Recognize from quadratic and non-quadratic SOCP forms. Helpful if
          the solver does not recognize non-standard forms

      Recognized SOCP forms can be further converted to (SOCP-standardized)
      quadratic constraints, see cvt:socp2qc. Default: 2.

cvt:socp2qc (socp2qcmode, socp2qc)
      Mode to convert recognized SOCP forms to SOCP-standardized quadratic
      constraints:

      0 - Do not convert
      1 - Convert if no other cone types found, and not all original
          quadratics could be recognized as SOC, in particular if the
          objective is quadratic
      2 - Always convert

      Such conversion can be necessary if the solver does not accept a mix of
      conic and quadratic constraints/objectives. Default: 2.

cvt:sos (sos)
      0/1*: Whether to honor declared suffixes .sosno and .ref describing SOS
      sets. Each distinct nonzero .sosno value designates an SOS set, of type
      1 for positive .sosno values and of type 2 for negative values. The .ref
      suffix contains corresponding reference values used to order the
      variables.

cvt:sos2 (sos2)
      0*/1: Whether to honor SOS2 constraints for nonconvex piecewise-linear
      terms, using suffixes .sos and .sosref provided by AMPL. Currently under
      rework.

cvt:uenc:negctx:max (uenc:negctx:max, cvt:uenc:negctx, uenc:negctx)
      If cvt:uenc:ratio applies, max number of constants in comparisons
      x==const in negative context (equivalently, x!=const in positive
      context), where const!=lb(x) and const!=ub(x), to skip unary encoding of
      x. Default 1.

      Example:

      var x in 1..9;
      var y >=1 <=200;
      
      s.t. Con: (x==9 || x==2 || x==6) ==> y >= 4;

      With uenc:negctx<=1, this triggers unary encoding for x.

cvt:uenc:ratio (uenc:ratio)
      Min ratio (ub-lb+1)/Nvalues to skip unary encoding for a variable x,
      where Nvalues is the number of constants used in conditional comparisons
      x==const. Instead, indicator constraints (or big-Ms) are used, if
      uenc:negctx also applies. Default 0.

      Example:

      var x in 1..9;
      var y >=1 <=200;
      
      s.t. Con: y>3 ==> (x==2 || x==6 || x==5);

      With uenc:ratio>3, this triggers unary encoding for x.

      4 - Suppress mipgap values in solve_message.

mip:rootcutlevel (rootcutlevel)

obj:multi (multiobj)

      0 - Single objective, see option obj:no (default)
      1 - Multi-objective, solver's native handling if available
      2 - Multi-objective, force emulation

      When obj:multi>0 and several objectives are present, suffixes
      .objpriority, .objweight, .objreltol, and .objabstol on the objectives
      are relevant. Objectives with greater .objpriority values (integer
      values) have higher priority. Objectives with the same .objpriority are
      weighted by .objweight, according to the option obj:multi:weight.

      Objectives with positive .objabstol or .objreltol are allowed to be
      degraded by lower priority objectives by amounts not exceeding the
      .objabstol (absolute) and .objreltol (relative) limits.

      Note that with solver's native handling (when obj:multi=1 and
      supported), some solvers might have special rules for the tolerances,
      especially for LP, and not allow quadratic objectives. See the solver
      documentation.

obj:multi:options (multiobjoptions)
      0/1*: Regard multiobjective option suffixes which are objective suffixes

      How to interpret each objective's weight sign:

      1 - relative to the sense of the 1st objective
      2 - relative to its own sense (default)

      With the 1st option (legacy behaviour), negative .objweight for
      objective i would make objective i's sense the opposite of the model's
      1st objective. Otherwise, it would make objective i's sense the opposite
      to its sense defined in the model.

obj:no (objno)
      Objective to optimize:

      0 - None
      1 - First (default, if available)
      2 - Second (if available), etc.

pre:scale (scale)
      Whether to scale the problem:

      -1 - Automatic choice (default)
      0  - No
      1  - Yes.

      Scaling typically reduces solution times, but it may lead to larger
      constraint violations in the original, unscaled model. Choosing a
      different scaling option can sometimes improve performance for
      particularly numerically difficult models.

pre:solve (presolve)
      Level of presolving to perform before solving the problem:

      -1 - Automatic (default)
      0  - Off
      1  - Fast
      2  - Normal
      3  - Aggressive

      8 - Check final auxiliary constraints sent to solver.
      16 - Check objective values.
      32, 64, 128, 256, 512 - similar, but non-linear expressions are
      recomputed (vs using their values reported by the solver.)

      consider possible tolerances applied by the solver when computing
      expression values.

      Name of an AMPL solver option file to read (surrounded by 'single' or
