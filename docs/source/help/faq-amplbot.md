## AI Companion for Optimization: amplbot

### What is amplbot?

Amplbot is a specialized AI assistant to help you develop and optimize models using the AMPL language and tools. It is integrated as a GPT into chatgpt.com. It's powered by the AMPL engine and trained on advanced modeling techniques, making it the perfect companion for optimization professionals, researchers, and students.

### Is amplbot free?

Yes, access it here at [Amplbot GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68c00de8b030819185be6db190ad7bce-amplbot).

### What can amplbot help me with?

Amplbot supports your entire optimization workflow, including:

* Learn AMPL syntax and modeling concepts.
* Formulate optimization problems in Python from natural language descriptions.
* Explain and debug optimization models.
* Troubleshoot issues like infeasibilities, unboundedness, or analyze the computational complexity of the model.
* Streamline integration with real-world data through Python.

### What makes amplbot different from other LLMs?

Since ChatGPT was released back in 2022, we experienced a high performance when writing and debugging AMPL code. We have been using it since then, and suggesting practitioners and students to use it.

Amplbot is an enhanced version over the already great average LLM performance while writing AMPL code. In particular, it's able to write optimization apps in a more accurate and modern way with amplpy, which is the most popular and convenient way of using AMPL nowadays.

Not only writing optimization applications, but amplbot is able to resolve issues with licenses, and explain in a correct way optimization concepts related to the theory or practical implementation.

We hope amplbot will smooth the learning curve for those who are new to optimization or AMPL, and help practitioners with their current or future projects better than the usual LLMs.

### How do I get started with amplbot?

Just start a conversation on chatgpt.com and ask for help with any optimization problem. Whether you're starting from scratch or refining an advanced model, amplbot adapts to your journey.

An excellent starting prompt could be:

### What are typical uses of amplbot?

It's really good at writing code to debug models, it may also simplify some algebraic constraints into logical ones that may be easier to understand and more efficient when sent to the solver instead of big-M formulations.

It might be a first option when looking into an optimization issue, or a license-related issue.

### Is amplbot able to help with complex models?

Definitely yes. Amplbot is not infallible, it's always a strong starting point when tackling big models.

### Does amplbot execute optimization code?

No, amplbot will only help you modeling the problem, but won't run the model.

Nonetheless, amplbot is designed to write optimization apps, so the code provided is usually ready-to-run in Python with Google Colab or Visual Studio Code.

### Do I need AMPL installed to use amplbot?

No, amplbot works directly in ChatGPT without requiring any local AMPL installation. It helps you write code, not execute it.

### Is amplbot accurate?

It usually works well with specific questions and building models from natural language. No LLM is free from hallucinations, so you should better check the replies. There is still a lot of room for improvement.
