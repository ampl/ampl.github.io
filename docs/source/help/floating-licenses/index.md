# Legacy Floating License Manager

```{warning}
Support of academic floating licenses is being discontinued. Please, consider using the Academic [Community Edition license](https://ampl.com/community-edition/), a simple and flexible approach to use AMPL and the solvers. See below how this compares to a floating license:

* The Academic Community Edition license is limited to each user personally, but it lets them use AMPL and solvers on any computer - even on more than one computer - at the same time.
* The use of AMPL and free academic solvers are included at no cost with this option.
* You are still required to validate your academic status each year (initial validations supported by an active academic email address).
* The license requires an Internet connection for communication with our license server (so it will not work without an Internet connection).
* As AMPL and the academic solvers you are receiving are free with this option, you will not be required to confirm your product renewal on a recurring basis (i.e., no invoicing process)

Please contact us if you have any issues in switching over to the Academic Community Edition.

AMPL offers a **floating license** facility that lets you share one or several AMPL and solver licenses over a greater number of computers and users.

To set up a floating license arrangement, you begin by choosing one computer as the license server. You install our floating license management program on the server, and also on every client computer where you might want to run AMPL and solvers. You also install the AMPL and solver software on each client.

Complete details are given on the following pages:

- The [Floating License Installation Guide](installation.md) explains the principles of AMPL floating licenses and gives instructions for installing a floating license configuration on your computers.
- The [Floating License Manager Guide](manager.md) explains the use of the program _ampl\_lic_ to manage client-server communication and to monitor the status of floating licenses.
- The [Floating License Configuration Guide](configuration.md) explains additional settings that can be added to floating license files, for example to change the communication port or state-file location.
- The [Floating License Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) gives instructions for interpreting common error messages and requesting technical support.
