# Legacy Floating License Manager

AMPL offers a **floating license** facility that lets you share one or several AMPL and solver licenses over a greater number of computers and users.

To set up a floating license arrangement, you begin by choosing one computer as the license server. You install our floating license management program on the server, and also on every client computer where you might want to run AMPL and solvers. You also install the AMPL and solver software on each client.

Complete details are given on the following pages:

- The [Floating License Installation Guide](installation.md) explains the principles of AMPL floating licenses and gives instructions for installing a floating license configuration on your computers.
- The [Floating License Manager Guide](manager.md) explains the use of the program _ampl\_lic_ to manage client-server communication and to monitor the status of floating licenses.
- The [Floating License Configuration Guide](configuration.md) explains additional settings that can be added to floating license files, for example to change the communication port or state-file location.
- The [Floating License Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) gives instructions for interpreting common error messages and requesting technical support.
