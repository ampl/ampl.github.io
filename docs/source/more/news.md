## “Logic” and Constraint Programming Extensions

**_22 October 2012:_** The AMPL language has been extended in a variety of ways to take better advantage of constraint programming and mixed-integer programming solvers that deal directly with “logic” in constraints of various kinds. Among these extensions are basic logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`, `exists`, `forall`), conditional operators (`if` `...` `then` `...`, `==>`), counting operators (`count`, `atleast`, `atmost`), and operators that facilitate so-called global constraints (`alldiff`, `numberof`).

Many of the extended operators are recognized by a new AMPL driver for the ILOG Concert Technology C++ interface to the IBM ILOG CP constraint programming optimizer and also the IBM CPLEX mixed-integer programming optimizer. This driver is available to all registered CPLEX for AMPL users including academic and trial license users.

See our new [logic extensions page](https://ampl.com/products/ampl/logic-and-constraint-programming-extensions/) for a syntax and usage summary of all of the extended operators recognized by the new `ilogcp` driver.

___

## Free Extended Function Library

**_22 October 2012:_** A new, free [function library](https://gsl.ampl.com/) extends AMPL with over 300 functions chosen from the GNU Scientific Library. Included are scientific, statistical, and utility functions of many kinds, and a variety of random number generators.

Once installed and declared, these functions may be applied to any arguments anywhere in an AMPL model or script. When applied to variables in objectives or constraints, they are sent to solvers, which automatically gain access to them. Thus solvers that rely on function evaluations can optimize over expressions that use this library.

___

## Xpress for AMPL Now Available

**_15 October 2012:_** FICO Xpress version 23 for linear, mixed integer, and quadratic programming is now available for purchase with an AMPL interface, directly from AMPL Optimization. A complete, udpated Xpress option listing details settings for access to all of the Xpress solver features. With this addition, we now offer a choice among all of the best MIP optimizers; free trials are available for benchmarking.
